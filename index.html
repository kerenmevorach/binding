				This website is a resource to learn about the pros and cons of learning about graphic design history in an educational setting. One&nbsp;article focuses on the importance of understanding graphic design history, while the others critique design history, and explain that we still have a lot more to learn. There is value in reading all three articles to understand both the benefits and drawbacks of what we have come to know as graphic design history. It is important to refer to the past to see what has been done to help inform our future designs. At the same time, what is considered to be traditional design history is very limiting. It tends to show one singular perspective, lacks diversity, and omits many important voices and designers. Collectively, these articles show the value and limits to learning about graphic design history, and explore possible alternatives. These&nbsp;articles also suggest how we can reshape design education by focusing less on graphic design as a profession, and more on critical topics that can help people understand their role and impact as designers&nbsp;today.

				The original article I chose, <em>Graphic Design’s Factory Settings</em>, suggests that design school has turned into a factory where students learn design history, technique, and how to design for society and for the purpose of capital. This article critiques what students typically learn in design history and explains that graphic design has become more commercialized over the years. Lindgren asks how we can reshape design education today, and suggests that design schools can teach students about “feminism, decoloniality, access to tools, anti-capitalism, ecological sustainability, queer praxis,” and&nbsp;more.

				I chose to include one article that takes a similar stance to Lindgren, and one that opposes it. <em>We Need Graphic Design Histories That Look Beyond the Profession</em> has a similar point of view on design history and education. It explains that graphic design history is focused on pivotal figures, works, and styles, and that people often view graphic design solely as a profession rather than a cultural practice. <em>Knowing Your Design History is Crucial to Aesthetic Innovation</em> focuses on how understanding design history can help inform our work. It does not completely oppose the opinion expressed in <em>Graphic Design’s Factory Settings</em>, but it focuses on the benefits of learning graphic design history, rather than its&nbsp;limitations.
